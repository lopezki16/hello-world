# hello-world
My first Git

Good evening fellow humans!

A bit about me: I am a graduate student in archaeology and geochemistry. I have not done much (any) coding really, but am needing to learn more for running R Statistical software, improve my GIS performance with Python, and write my thesis and other documents and articles in LaTeX. While this is fairly late in the game for such steep learning curves, I am excited to get these tidbits in motion. I am enjoy fine control and understanding why/how things work, so I feel this will be a positive direction for me. If only I can keep my brain from glazing over and checking out while trying to learn all this...

Any suggestions on study technique or practice strategies are welcome.
